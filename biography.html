            <p class="alphabet-paragraph-1">As you can probably tell this website is still a work in 
                progress, I will continue to add more interesting things to it as I learn more about web design and coding.
                I am a junior graphic designer who also wants to do website design (HTML and CSS) . I am based in the New England area, 
                striving to try and work in Kyoto/Tokyo or Osaka, Japan. I focus on logo/branding design and website design, wanting 
                to illustrate more. The type of work that I tend to gravitate toward is website design and branding for companies. 
                Other creative ideas that I love to design around are bold designs with a lot of colors and interesting fonts, 
                willing to work in all other design types as well. I approach design with multiple mock ups making sure I have 
                original designs so I can reference back to them and I have the original if I want to go back to it. The values 
                I always strive for is collaboration on the project itself, no matter what it is I would always love feedback 
                and constructive criticism so I can improve on the design. I always want a lot of my pieces to be full of 
                character, geared to the client's wants and needs that they want to see in their branding/logo/website. 
                Inclusive design for everyone, as well as collaboration with other mediums of design. What inspires me
                outside of a design aspect is japanese culture, fashion such as streetwear, as well as the 90's and grunge
                aesthetic. I am always looking for new things to learn and try out, so if you have any suggestions please 
                let me know! Some other things that a geared towards non-design aspects of my life is that I am a very active
                K-pop dancer, I am also a part of a K-pop dance group called "K-Pop Dance Crew" where we do covers of songs 
                and perform at events.
